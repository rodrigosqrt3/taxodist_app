A Shiny web application for computing **taxonomic distances and exploring phylogenetic lineages**, powered by the [taxodist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxodist/index.html) R package and [The Taxonomicon](https://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/) database.

## Live App

**[https://3w6g1b-rodrigo-villa.shinyapps.io/taxodist_app/](https://3w6g1b-rodrigo-villa.shinyapps.io/taxodist_app/)**

## Features

The app exposes the main functions of the `taxodist` package through an interactive interface with six tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pairwise Distance** | Compute the taxonomic distance between any two taxa, with full lineage comparison and MRCA highlighted |
| **Distance Matrix** | Build a pairwise distance matrix for a list of taxa, with an interactive table and a publication-ready dendrogram |
| **Closest Relative** | Given a query taxon and a set of candidates, rank them by taxonomic proximity |
| **Lineage Explorer** | Retrieve the full lineage of any taxon and check clade membership |
| **Coverage Check** | Verify which taxa in a list are present in The Taxonomicon database |
| **Filter by Clade** | Filter a list of taxa, retaining only those belonging to a given clade |

## The `taxodist` package

This app is a graphical front-end for the [`taxodist`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxodist/index.html) R package. To use `taxodist` directly in R:

```r
install.packages("taxodist")
library(taxodist)

# Pairwise distance
taxo_distance("Tyrannosaurus", "Velociraptor")

# Distance matrix
distance_matrix(c("Homo", "Canis", "Quercus", "Drosophila"))

# Full lineage
get_lineage("Homo sapiens")

# Check clade membership
is_member("Tyrannosaurus", "Theropoda")
```

## How taxonomic distance is computed

The distance between two taxa A and B is defined as:

$$d(A, B) = \frac{1}{\text{depth}(\text{MRCA}(A, B))}$$

where MRCA is the Most Recent Common Ancestor of A and B in The Taxonomicon hierarchy, and depth is its position from the root. Taxa that share a more recent (deeper) ancestor receive a smaller distance value.
