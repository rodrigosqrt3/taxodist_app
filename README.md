A multilingual Shiny web application for computing taxonomic distances and exploring taxonomic hierarchies, powered by the [taxodist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxodist/index.html) R package and [The Taxonomicon](https://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/) database. 

Available in English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, and German.

## Features

The app exposes the main functions of the `taxodist` package through an interactive interface with seven tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Pairwise Distance** | Compute the taxonomic distance between any two taxa, with full lineage comparison and MRCA highlighted |
| **Distance Matrix** | Build a pairwise distance matrix from pasted names or a CSV file, inspect the table, and explore average-linkage clustering and PCoA |
| **Closest Relative** | Given a query taxon and a set of candidates, rank them by taxonomic proximity |
| **Lineage Explorer** | Retrieve the full lineage of any taxon and check clade membership |
| **Search Database** | Search The Taxonomicon for candidate records and numeric identifiers |
| **Coverage Check** | Verify which taxa in a list are present in The Taxonomicon database |
| **Filter by Clade** | Filter a list of taxa, retaining only those belonging to a given clade |

The matrix and coverage tabs accept comma- or semicolon-separated CSV files.
Recognized column names include `taxon`, `taxa`, `species`, `name`, and
`scientific_name`; in a headerless file, the first column is used. The app also
offers a downloadable template; [`example_taxa.csv`](example_taxa.csv) can be
used as a quick upload test.

## The `taxodist` package

This app is a graphical front-end for the [`taxodist`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/taxodist/index.html) R package. To use `taxodist` directly in R:

```r
install.packages("taxodist")
library(taxodist)

# Pairwise distance
taxo_distance("Tyrannosaurus", "Velociraptor")

# Distance matrix
distance_matrix(c("Homo", "Canis", "Quercus", "Drosophila"))

# Full lineage
get_lineage("Homo sapiens")

# Check clade membership
is_member("Tyrannosaurus", "Theropoda")
```

## How taxonomic distance is computed

The distance between two taxa A and B is defined as:

$$
d(A,B) =
\begin{cases}
0, & A = B, \\
\dfrac{1}{\text{depth}(\text{MRCA}(A,B))}, & A \ne B.
\end{cases}
$$

where MRCA is the Most Recent Common Ancestor of A and B in The Taxonomicon hierarchy, and depth is its position from the root. Taxa that share a more recent (deeper) ancestor receive a smaller distance value. Zero is reserved for identical hierarchy nodes; distinct ancestor-descendant pairs therefore have positive distance.

These values describe depth in a taxonomic classification. They are not
evolutionary time, genetic distance, or phylogenetic branch lengths. Likewise,
the dendrogram and PCoA are representations of the supplied hierarchy-distance
matrix, not independently inferred phylogenies.
